# sri24 Package:

The goal of `sri24` is to provide sRI24 is an ‘MRI’-based atlas of
normal adult human brain anatomy, generated by template-free nonrigid
registration from images of 24 normal control subjects. The atlas
comprises ‘T1’, ‘T2’, and ‘PD’ weighted structural ‘MRI’, tissue
probability maps (‘GM’, ‘WM’, ‘CSF’), maximum-likelihood tissue
segmentation, ‘DTI’-based measures (‘FA’, ‘MD’, longitudinal and
transversal diffusivity), and two labels maps of cortical regions and
subcortical structures.

## Installation

You can install `sri24` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("muschellij2/sri24")
```

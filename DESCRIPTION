Title: SRI24 MRI Atlas for Normal Adult Brain Anatomy
Description: SRI24 is an 'MRI'-based atlas of normal adult human brain anatomy, generated by template-free nonrigid registration from images of 24 normal control subjects. The atlas comprises 'T1', 'T2', and 'PD' weighted structural 'MRI', tissue probability maps ('GM', 'WM', 'CSF'), maximum-likelihood tissue segmentation, 'DTI'-based measures ('FA', 'MD', longitudinal and transversal diffusivity), and two labels maps of cortical regions and subcortical structures.
